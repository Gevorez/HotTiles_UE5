Second project in Unreal Engine 5. The main idea is to create 3D platform game, where player need to compete with other enemies on disappearing tiles. Inspired by "Fall Guys"

# Idea

The main goal of the game is to stay on the disappearing tiles as long as possible.
A similar solution can be found in the game "FallGuys".
